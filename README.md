'Cause, what the world needs now
Is another Blog Platform
Like I need a hole in my head
```

This isn't meant to be another full featured blogging platform, rather it's the simple and straight forward platform I want to run my own blog.  None of the current offerings are exactly what I wanted, so here we are.

## Prerequisites

You will need [Leiningen][1] 1.7.0 or above installed.
